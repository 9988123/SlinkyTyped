  * The Accessibility manager recreates the ability to tab and have content read by screen readers.
  * This is very important as it can possibly help people with disabilities access PixiJS content.
  *
  * A DisplayObject can be made accessible just like it can be made interactive. This manager will map the
  * events as if the mouse was being used, minimizing the effort required to implement.
  *
  * An instance of this class is automatically created by default, and can be found at `renderer.plugins.accessibility`
